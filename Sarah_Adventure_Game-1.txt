Welcome to the text adventure game based on the German fairy tale Hansel and 
Gretel.

Firstly there is an introduction and the player can choose the character he
wants to play. After choosing the character Stage 1 of the game starts. 

Stage 1: 
The player must decide whether to start walking into the forest or to
build a shelter. If he decides to stay and build a shelter, the game will end 
after 2 stages. If the player decides to start walking you can play all five
stages.

Stage 2: 
The player encounters the witch's gingerbread house. 
They must decide whether to go inside or to avoid it.
If the player chooses to go inside, they will be faced with a puzzle to solve
in order to escape. 

Stage 3: 
In stage 3 the player needs to solve a riddle in order to escape the
witch. The are three trials in order to solve it, and the player will be given
a hint if he inputs a wrong answer. If after three trials the riddle is not
solved the game is over. 

Stage 4: 
After solving the riddle they escaped the witches house and now need
to decide which path to take home. There is a long safe path and a short
dangerous path.
If the player decides to take the long path he gets home and wins the game. 
If the player takes the short path wolves appear and the player needs to 
decide whether to run from them or to fight them. 

Stage 5:
In stage five the player encounters woolves and needs to either run from them 
or fight them. If he manages to do one of both he wins the game and gets back
home. 

    
B) Known Bugs and/or Errors:
    None.
